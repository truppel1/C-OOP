Make a program to read an integer N and then the data (id, name and salary) of
N employees. There must be no repetition of id.

Then, increase the salary of a given employee by X percent.

For this, the program must read an id and the value X. If the informed id does not exist, display a
message and abort the operation. At the end, show the updated list of employees,
according to examples.

Remember to apply the encapsulation technique to not allow the salary to
be changed freely. A salary can only be increased on the basis of a
increase by given percentage.
